# *Breast Cancer Clinical Data Set Repository*
This data set on breast cancer patients comes from the surveillance, epidemiology, and end results program of the National Cancer Institute. The data set contains information collected in November of 2017 involving female patients with infiltrating duct and lobular carcinoma breast cancer who had been diagnosed between the years of 2006 and 2010. 

The purpose is to display a clinical comparison between patients within the same demograpic groups allowing for standardized demographics for a uniform anaylisis of clinical components only.  

The potential uses for this data include:

- Viewable trend of cancer related clinical data within a uniform demographic
- Establishing general clinical trends
- Visualization of clinical results 

## Getting Started

The subset and original data has been included in the format of a .csv file. 

## Reproducibility

To see the how this data was produced consult the colab notebook file.
